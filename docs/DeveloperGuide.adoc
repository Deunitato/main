== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::TripManagement[]

=== Trip Management
*_E.T._* only allow the user to manage one trip at a time and is necessary to be used first before other commands are available. This is done using the `settrip` command which requires the user to specify the `title` of the trip, the `budget` of the trip and the `start date` and `end date` of the entire trip.
For example, `settrip title/cheese budget/2000 startdate/20-09-20 enddate/28-09-20` means that the trip with the title `cheese land` will be set with a budget of `2000` dollars and a duration of 8 days between `20-09-20' to `28-09-20`.


==== Rationale
The Trip Manager feature is the main driving feature that allows the users to set their trip schedule, budget as well
as the duration of the trip.
The Trip manager oversees the feature schedule and is essential to be set first before the user is allow to access any other features within the application. This is for the application to ensure that user must have a trip in mind before being allowed to plan for the trip.

==== Current Implementation
The keywords from the command given by user is parsed using `SetTripCommandParser` which converts the string
variable of the `startDate` and `endDate` into a java `Date` object, the `title` into a `Title` object while the `budget` is converted into `Budget` objects.
These objects are used to create the `SetTripCommand` object that can be execution to create the trip. Execution of this object would hence enable other features within the application.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `SetTripCommand` object:

.Sequence diagram that describes the creation of the `SetTripCommand` from the input user command `settrip title/cheese budget/2000 startdate/20-09-20 enddate/28-09-20`.
image::developer-guide/trip/SetTripCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of the `SetTripCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `SetTripCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `SetTripCommand`:

1. The `Schedule` object, `Budget` object, `startDate` and `endDate` is passed into the `createTrip()` method of `Model` and parse into a `Trip` object.
2. A new `Scheduler` will be created while `Budget` object, `startDate` and `endDate` object given by the `Trip object`  .
3. The `trip` object will calculate and initialise the `duration` of the trip using the given `startDate` and `endDate`.
4. `Trip` would enable access to other commands within application.

The sequence diagram below shows the the execution of `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

.Sequence diagram that describes the execution of ScheduleActivityCommand.
image::developer-guide/trip/f.png[SetTrip Command Execution PlaceHolder]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Trip is isolated from any list manager

* **Current Choice:** Trip is isolated from all list managing
** Pros: Better user experience. Single Responsibility: only handles objects necessary for a `trip` to exist
and be added into the schedule.
** Cons: Complicated to implement and more likely to result in bugs.

===== Aspect: Creation of trip is required before use of any other commands

* **Current Choice:** A trip must be created before use of any other commands
** Pros: Ensures that users cannot implement any activity or schedule without creation of an activity.

===== Aspect: Creation of trip is required before use of any other commands

* **Current Choice:** A trip must be created before use of any other commands
** Pros: Ensures that users cannot implement any activity or schedule without creation of an activity.
** Cons: Complicate to implement and likely result in dependency issues
// end::Trip Management[]


// end::Check Status[]
=== Check Status
==== Rationale

Currently, E.T allows a user to keep track of multiple aspects of a trip.
However, they exist as separate lists and there is little to no integration between them.

For example, the fixed expense list has little to no correlation with the packing list, but they are both
important aspects of a trip. As such, the motivation behind creating a “check status” is to create that missing link between the different lists and make E.T more integrated and easier to use for the user.

This feature allows the user to compress all the information from the lists into a single pane and
alerts the user if they have forgotten to plan for a certain aspect of a trip.
Before this, the user would have to scroll through each list, look at what they might have forgotten to plan or do.

Therefore, this would help reduce the amount of information the user would need to process, and indirectly the stresses which accompany the planning for a trip.

==== Overview
E.T’s database stores a hard-coded checklist. For example, it would check if the user has planned for an
accommodation booking for every single day of the trip and would be informed through the
`checkstatus` command if they have forgotten to plan for it.

*TIP*
However, users can also include their own preset `checkstatus` to suit their needs {v2.0}

==== Current Implementation
The `checkstatus` command checks what the user have planned against the checklist from our database.
The `checkstatus` command is created by parsing the user’s inputs to form a `checkStatusCommand` where E.T’s
database is filtered to return the user with the checklist.

The following activity diagram shown in <<Figure x.x>> below, summarizes what happens when a user enters a `checkstatus`
command:


.Sequence diagram showing the workflow of a `checkstatus` command.
image::developer-guide/check-status-feature/CheckStatusCommandExecution.png[]

In detail, whenever a “checkstatus” command is entered,
the command will be identified by E.T by parsing it through the `eTParser` through the `Logic` component.
A `CheckStatusCommand` will be created.
E.T will then check against the hard-coded database and generate a checklist of what the
user might have forgotten to prepare for their upcoming trip.
The following sequence diagram shown in <<Figure x.x>> below,
summarizes the sequence flow when a user enters a valid `checkstatus` command:


[KIV]
Figure x.x: Sequence diagram of a “checkstatus” command.

From the sequence diagram:

****
1.	When the `LogicManager` receives the “execute” command from `MainApp`, it will call the `parseCommand` method of
`eTParser`.
2.	`eTParser` will receive `checkstatus` as the command type and instantiate `CheckStatusCommand`
3.	Through `Model”, the `CheckStatusCommand` will check the individual lists
against the hard-coded database in `Storage` to ensure that the user had made sufficient planning for the trip.
4. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` back to `LogicManager` if the user had made
sufficient planning for the upcoming trip.
5.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `CheckStatusCommand`, `LogicManager` will then proceed to
return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the checklist will be shown to the user.
****

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Access to all list

*** Choice 1: Check status has access to all list

** Pros: Easy to implement and understand. Check status can call and access all variables from the lists.

** Cons: There might be dependency issues.


// tag::scheduleactivity[]
=== Schedule feature
*_E.T._* allows the user to schedule an activity from the activity list to a specified time of a day.
This is done using the `schedule` command which requires the user to specify the `activity index` of an activity from
the displayed activity list, the `day number` of the trip and the `start time` of the activity to be scheduled. For
example, `schedule 1 day/2 starttime/13:00` means that the activity with the index of `1` will be schedule on the second
day of the trip at 1pm. Before using the `schedule` command, the user should have filled up the activity list with
activities.

==== Rationale
The schedule feature is an important feature that allows the users to manage and plan for their trip schedule or itinerary.
This feature is separated from the activity management feature to increase the ease of planning because users can just focus
on the time management aspect when scheduling proposed activities from the activity list.

==== Current Implementation
The keywords from the command given by user is parsed using `ScheduleActivityCommandParser` which converts the string
variable of the `start time` into a java `Time` object, while `activity index` and `day number` are converted into `Index` objects.
These objects are used to create the `ScheduleActivityCommand` object that can be execution to schedule the activity.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `ScheduleActivityCommand` object:

.Sequence diagram that describes the creation of the `ScheduleActivityCommand` from the input user command `schedule 1 day/2 starttime/13:00`.
image::developer-guide/schedule-feature/ScheduleActivityCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of the `ScheduleActivityCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `ScheduleActivityCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

1. `Model` retrieves the list of activities from the `UniqueList` that stores `Activity` objects.
2. The `activityIndex` is used to obtain the target `Activity` from the activity list.
3. The `Activity` object, `dayIndex` and `startTime` is passed into the `scheduleActivity()` method of `Model`.
4. `Activity` is converted to a `Schedulee` object using the `startTime` from the `ScheduleActivityCommand`, the `title` and `duration` from the target `Activity`.
5. The `Schedulee` object is added to the target day's `DaySchedule`.
6. The list of `Schedulee` is sorted according to the `startTime`.

The sequence diagram below shows the the execution of `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

.Sequence diagram that describes the execution of ScheduleActivityCommand.
image::developer-guide/schedule-feature/ScheduleActivityCommandExecution.png[Schedule Activity Command Execution]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Separation between scheduling and activity management

* **Current Choice:** Scheduling is separated from activity management.
** Pros: Better user experience. Allows for extension: other type of objects could easily be converted into a `Schedulee` object
and be added into the schedule.
** Cons: Complicated to implement and more likely to result in bugs.
* **Alternative:** Activity must be scheduled directly into a day.
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Increase difficulty planning for users and limit the schedule to `Activity` objects only.


// tag::transportbooking[]
=== Transport Booking feature

E.T. allows the user to add a transport booking. This is done using the schedule command which requires the user to specify the mode, start location, end location, start time and end time.

==== Rationale

The transport booking feature is an important feature that allows the user to track the list of transport bookings that they have made before leaving.
This feature also allows the user to schedule their activities while taking the scheduled transport bookings into consideration.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddTransportBookingCommandParser` which converts the string variable `mode` into a `Mode` object, `start location` and `end location` into a `Location` objects, as well as `start time` and `end time` into `Time` objects.
These objects are used to create the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object that will execute to create a transport booking.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object:

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of a `addtransport` command.
image::developer-guide/transport-booking/AddTransportBookingActivityDiagram.png[]

After the creation of the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddTransportBookingCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddTransportBookingCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddTransportBookingCommand` checks the current transport booking list for duplicates before adding the new object into the transport booking list
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the transport booking into the transport booking list
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddTransportBookingCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated transport booking list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:**
** Pros:
** Cons:

* **Alternative:**
** Pros:
** Cons:
// end::transportbooking[]

// tag::accommodationbooking[]
=== Accommodation Booking feature

E.T. allows the user to add an accommodation booking. This is done using the schedule command which requires the user to specify the accommodation name, location, start day, end day and a remark.

==== Rationale

The accommodation booking feature is an important feature that allows the user to track the list of accommodation bookings that they have made before leaving.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddTransportBookingCommandParser` which converts the string variable `accommodation name` into a `AccommodationName` object, `location` into a `Location` object, `start day` and `end day` into `Day` objects, as well as `remark` into a `Remark` object.
These objects are used to create the `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` object that will execute to create an accommodation booking.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` object:

[KIV]
Figure x.x: Sequence diagram of a Add Accommodation Booking command.

After the creation of the `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddAccommodationBookingCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddAccommodationBookingCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` checks the current accommodation booking list for duplicates before adding the new object into the accommodation booking list
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the accommodation booking into the accommodation booking list
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddAccommodationBookingCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated accommodation booking list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:**
** Pros:
** Cons:

* **Alternative:**
** Pros:
** Cons:
// end::accommodationbooking[]

// tag::activity[]
=== Activity Manager
*_E.T._* allows the user to plan for their `activity` for a trip. The activity manager handles everything to do with manipulating of activities.

This `addactivity` command requires the user to include the `title` of an activity, the `priority` of the activity , the `duration` of the activity in terms of hours, `Location` of the activity and optional `tags`.

List of commands that helps with activity management:

* `addactivity title/TITLE priority/PRIORITY duration/DURATION location/LOCATION t/TAG` --  create an activity with the given title, priority, duration, location and tags. There can be more than one tags included
* `clearactivity`  -- Clears the entire activity list
* `deleteactivity index`  -- Deletes the activity based on index
* `editactivity index [title/TITLE] [priority/PRIORITY] [duration/DURATION] [location/LOCATION] [t/TAG]` -- Edits the activity based on index

Example:

`addactivity title/Big Cheese Land priority/1 duration/2 location/The moon t/nice` will create an activity named `Big Cheese` with a priority of `1` , duration of `2` and is happening at a location `The moon`. The activity would also have the tag `nice`


The user can use any other activity command if there exist at least one activity in the list.

==== Rationale
The activity manager allows user to plan and manage their activities for the trip.
The activity manager only handles activities and the manipulation of activities.

==== Current Implementation
The keywords from the command given by user is parsed using a parser for the respective command

e.g `DeleteActivityCommandParser`

These objects are used to create the command object for their respective command that can be execution to schedule the activity.

e.g `DeleteActivity`

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of a `deleteactivity` command.
image::developer-guide/activity/DeleteActivityActivityDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the an ActivityCommand object:

.Sequence diagram that describes the creation of the `deleteactivity` from the input user command `deleteactivity 1`.

image::developer-guide/activity/DeleteActivityCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of the `DeleteActivityCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `DeleteActivityCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

1. `Model` retrieves the list of activities from the `UniqueList` that stores `Activity` objects.
2. The `activityIndex` is used to find the target `Activity` from the activity list.
3. The `Activity` object that corresponds to the index is removed from the list


The sequence diagram below shows the the execution of `DeleteActivityCommand`:

.Sequence diagram that describes the execution of ScheduleActivityCommand.
image::developer-guide/activity/DeleteActivityCommandExecution.png[Delete Activity Command Execution placeholder]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Activity does not keep track of the day

* **Current Choice:** Days is being tracked by scheduler
** Pros: Separation of concerns: Only the scheduler should know which day the activity is held on.
** Cons: {kiv}
// end::activity[]

// tag::packinglist[]
=== Packing List feature

*_E.T._* allows the user to create a packing list. The packing list manager handles everything to do with manipulating of packing list items.

This `additem` command requires the user to include the `item` name of an item, the `quantity` of the item , and the `category` of the item.

==== Rationale
The packing list feature is an important feature that allows the users to plan and pack for their trip. It ensures that the user did not forget to pack anything for their trip, providing convenience.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddItemCommandParser` which converts the string variable `item name` into an `ItemName` object, `quantity` into a `Quantity` object, as well as `category` into a `ItemCategory` object.
These objects are used to create the `AddItemCommand` object that will execute to create a packing list item.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `AddItemCommand` object:

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of an `additem` command.
image::developer-guide/packing-list/AddPackingListActivityDiagram.png[]

After the creation of the `AddItemCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddItemCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddItemCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddItemCommand` checks the current packing list for duplicates before adding the new object into the packing list
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the item into the packing list
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddItemCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated packing list is shown

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:**
** Pros:
** Cons:

* **Alternative:**
** Pros:
** Cons:
// end::packinglist[]

// tag::fixedexpense[]
=== Fixed expense feature

*_E.T._* allows the user to create a fixed expense. The fixed expense manager handles everything to do with manipulating of fixed expenses.

This `addexpense` command requires the user to include the `amount` of the fixed expense, the `description` of the fixed expense , the `category` of the fixed expense, as well as the optional `amountSGD` and `amountOTHR`

==== Rationale
The fixed expense feature is an important feature that allows the users to plan financially for their trip. It allows the user keeps track of the amount spent on the big ticket items, such as plane tickets and accommodation bookings.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddFixedExpenseCommandParser` which converts the string variable `amount` into an `Amount` object, `description` into a `Description` object, as well as `category` into a `Category` object.
These objects are used to create the `AddFixedExpenseCommand` object that will execute to create a fixed expense.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `AddFixedExpenseCommand` object:

[KIV]
Figure x.x: Sequence diagram of a Add Fixed Expense command.

After the creation of the `AddFixedExpenseCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddFixedExpenseCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddFixedExpenseCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddFixedExpenseCommand` checks the current fixed expense for duplicates before adding the new object into the fixed expense list
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the fixed expense into the fixed expense list
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddFixedExpenseCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated fixed expense list is shown

// end::fixedexpense[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
